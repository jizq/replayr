Simple replay of apache log files, bodged together from little bits of python and held together with sticky tape.

Currently full of @todo's, needs a refactor to clean it up and probably bugs as well but surprisingly it actually works!

More @todo's as we use the script:
1. Sort the wiki out!
2. Allow custom throttling to increase the speed by a factor of x
3. Allow complete removal of throttling to allow the script to run as fast as possible
4. Stats, stats and more stats!

Name from a combination of myself and https://github.com/robyoung so don't just blame me!
