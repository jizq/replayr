Simple replay of apache log files, bodged together from little bits of python and held together with sticky tape.

Currently full of @todo's, needs a refactor to clean it up and probably bugs as well but surprisingly it actually works!

Name from a combination of myself and https://github.com/robyoung so don't just blame me!
